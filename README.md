### Predicting Forest Covertypes using Neural Networks

A basic neural network used to predict forest covertypes from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository Covertype dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/31/covertype)

To get started:
- Do ```git clone https://github.com/luoj21/covtype_nn.git```
- Create a virtual environment: ```python3 -m venv .venv```
- Activate the environment```source .venv/bin/activate```
- Install packages: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- Run ```train.py``` to train/evaluate the model
